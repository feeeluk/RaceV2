Version 2 of my initial project!

Why did I start a new version?
Prior to this all of the things I was learning I could just add or amend code as necessary without needing to make any significant changes to the way the application worked.

However, to encorporate the latest thing that I have learned - entity framework - a fundamental change is required.
